      What is MetaMoves NFT Project?
    </label>
    <div class="answers font-normal">
      <p> MetaMoves is a collection of unique motion capture data files living as NFTs on the Ethereum Blockchain, that began in late January 2022, and it is the first NFT project of its kind. Each movement is a 3D animated design meticulously crafted to convey a message by matching visuals with sound. MetaMoves are adaptable to any T-pose avatar, can be used several times, and are Metaverse friendly.</p>
      <p> The project had released 2 small collections of 1:1 movements already, both times the collection sold out in less than 30 minutes. Some of the movements can be found on the secondary market in Portion or Opensea. The official launch date of a larger MetaMoves collection will be announced on social media soon.</p>

      What am I actually buying?
    </label>
    <div class="answers font-normal">
      <p>When buying a MetaMove you get an fbx/bvh/mp4 file that can be applied to any T-pose avatar as many times as you wish. Note that you do not get the robot displayed but the moves. Holders of MetaMoves get backstage sneak peek access, an exclusive Discord channel, early access to releases, and much more as the community develops.</p>
      <p>For the time being, you will be required to send your avatar to this email address metamoves@cinetica.studio, the team will apply the movement for you and send it back. Soon Cin√©tica will launch a retargeting feature for holders to try movements on avatars.</p>

      Why do I need MetaMoves?
    </label>
    <div class="answers font-normal">
      <p>How many times have you recognized someone from far just by the way she/he was moving or walking? Movements are an essential part of who we are as human beings, and at MetaMoves we believe the same apply for avatars.  </p>
      <p>MetaMoves helps avatars to communicate through movements, express their thoughts, feelings, and strengths. You can use your MetaMove in as many avatars as you wish and move around the metaverse.</p>

      Where can I use my MetaMoves?
    </label>
    <div class="answers font-normal">
      <p>Anywhere you display an avatar, you can actually display an avatar with one of the MetaMoves. Gamers can use it during a game or you can go shop on the metaverse and impress the buyer with an exclusive move. Not even the sky is the limit, use your imagination and share any cool idea you might have.</p>

      Do I get commercial rights with my NFT?
    </label>
    <div class="answers font-normal">
      <p>A holder of MetaMoves owns the NFT. Holders of 1:1 receive (1) a worldwide, royalty-free personal license to use and display the art associated with purchased NFT, in platforms and/or piece of content (2) a commercial license to make merchandise that displays the art associated with the NFT MetaMoves, a license subject to a $100,000 gross revenue per year limit.</p>
      <p>To clarify the above, note that as in most other projects, when purchasing a MetaMoves you are not purchasing the intellectual property rights in such a piece of content. In other words, holders do not own the underlying copyright in the content the NFT is associated with or the right to replicate, reproduce, and/or display that media on third-party products, websites, or platforms. MetaMoves, therefore Cin√©tica Studio, preserves the right to use and commercialize the mocap at any time and forever.</p>
      <p>In the case a holder is willing to sell the MetaMoves, she/he should do so through established NFT marketplaces to avoid clandestine sells that could potentially hurt MetaMoves NFT project trajectory and growth.</p>
